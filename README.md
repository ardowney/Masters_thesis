# Title: Linking organic carbon to depositional history of cave sediments using fluorescence spectroscopy 
## data repository containing all R and bash scripts used during this masters project 
###  R scripts include:
 - organizing raw particle size data from a Beckman Coulter single wavelength LS13-320 particle size analyzer from the instrument into a csv format 
 - post-processing fluorescence spectroscopy data from a Horiba Fluorolog-3


### Data source:
Data was collected from two cave systems in Puerto Rico
